"""
Example: Using LinkSuggester for wikilink suggestions.

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a LinkSuggester instance
- Getting link suggestions for content
- Understanding semantic, keyword, and graph-based matching
- Detecting bidirectional link opportunities
- Recording feedback to improve suggestions

Requirements:
- A vault with multiple notes already ingested
- Optional: Embeddings for semantic suggestions
